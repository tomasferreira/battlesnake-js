* [Express](https://expressjs.com/)

## (Optional) Running Your Battlesnake Locally

Eventually you might want to run your Battlesnake server locally for faster testing and debugging. You can do this by installing [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and running:

```shell
npm install
npm start
```

**Note:** You cannot create games on [play.battlesnake.com](https://play.battlesnake.com) using a locally running Battlesnake unless you install and use a port forwarding tool like [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/). See [Hosting Suggestions.](https://docs.battlesnake.com/references/hosting-suggestions#local)

## Running Tests

This Starter Project comes with a very simple test suite for you to expand! Located in `test/logic.spec.js` you can run them using the following command:
```shell
npm test
```
